Bootstrap uses a grid system to simplify the layout of a website based off of flexbox which organizes content in rows or columns

At the heart of this grid, -containers- are the basis. Inside of these containers we nest -rows- as immediate children, and then
we nest -columns- as children of rows. Inside of these columns is where the content will live

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <!-- A column inside a row inside a container! -->
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

The container, by default, will have a width relative to a user's screen size, become horizontally centered, and have a left and 
right margin

If we wanted to container to take up the entire width of the screen we can assign a class of 'container-fluid'

    <div class="container-fluid"></div>

We can add as many rows per container as wanted and by default a row will take up the entire width of its parent container

By default, a column will take up the entire width of its parent row. As more columns are added inside of a row the default
behavior is for each column's width to be readjusted to fit in the row (each column will have the same width)

At most, a row can accommodate 12 columns

To decide the width of a column, append a hyphen and a number to the "col" class. If a specified width for a second (or third-12)
column was not given, it will resize itself to fill in the remaining space in the row

    <div class="col-8">
        <p>This is the width of 8 columns.</p>
    </div>

Alternatively, to set the width of a column as the width of the content inside of the column, just append "auto" to the col class

    <div class="col-auto">
        <p>This content determines the width of the parent column</p>
    </div>
